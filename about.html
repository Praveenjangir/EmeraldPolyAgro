            Torches has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.</p></i>
        <p><i>Emerald was created at Taranagar in 2014 by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@ASHOK JANGIR</a> and <a
                href="https://twitter.com/fat"></a>. Prior to being an open-sourced framework, Emerald was known as <em>
                green color and which is also a symbol of farmers.</em>. the project exploded as developers of all skill
            levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at
            the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.</p></i>
